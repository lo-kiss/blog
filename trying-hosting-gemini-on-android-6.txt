Trying to host on gemini using an Android 6.
Published on 6 September 2023

It all started with a poor Loki wanting to host a blog, but he was tired of
the practices of the web, and so he thought he'd look for something a bit more
different:

Gemini.
 ▄▀  ██▀ █▄ ▄█ █ █▄ █ █
 ▀▄█ █▄▄ █ ▀ █ █ █ ▀█ █

I'm a huge sucker for alternatives and "weird" software that tries to look at
things differently and is not afraid of it. Gemini is essentially a smaller web 
protocol, but without the shitty web practices. No HTML, CSS or Javascript to 
annoy the shit out of you with ads, weird layouts and forced behavior with 
Javascript. You have control over there, no unsolicited requests unless the 
user explicitly says so. It's just heaven for a minimalist like me.

Well, this is all super cool and all, but... how do I publish? Fact is that I 
never hosted anything in my life and on top of that I really don't have the 
best financial situation to allow me to buy dedicated hosting devices. I know 
they're not that costly, especially for something small like gemini, but I'm 
trying to save for a decent computer. I could use a platform that hosts the 
content for me, but that's one of the reasons I don't want to use github for my
blog. I want to feel like it's mine and I have absolute control over it. 

So, I have one other option and that's to use spare devices around the house.
There's an ASUS Android device that wants to act like a camera? I think its main
intention is to be a camera with the phone functionality attached to it, but 
it's just weird all around. It has decent specs that honestly surprised me: 
4 GB RAM, 128 GB storage. This beats my phone on storage. 
Only, there's one problem: Android 6 plus all the shit ASUS might have 
changed or added.

I probably can't root it, because the developer options are there, but there's
no OEM unlocking option. Now, that's fine (I think), this device is for
one purpose only and that's to host a gemini capsule. It would be awesome if 
it was that easy. Here are the struggles I faced until now:

- Termux uses a different repository for Android 6 and lower packages. There are
absolutely no packages related to gemini on there;

- Ok, how about compiling a gemini server from source? Sounds fine, let's try
to compile agate, a gemini server in rust. First problem: it complained about
the cargo edition being unknown so apparently it's because it's outdated.
I tried updating using the command from the rust lang website and here comes the
second problem: did I mention that this device is i686? Apparently, you can't 
compile *on* i648, but you can compile *for* i686 with the rust compiler. (I'm 
not a rust dev so I apologize if I got it wrong);

- Alright, let's look for another server written in C this time, gmid. All was fine,
I looked at dependencies and most of them were in the termux repo. Keyword: most.
There was libtls that was not available and that makes it not compile :(.

...And that's where I left things at. I was super tired by the end of the day
and I decided to take a break from this for a while. Maybe I will come up with
a solution until then. It would be a shame if I couldn't use this device for 
anything else because it's got quite the specs, but yeah "smart"phones and their
manufacturers.

Until then, I'm hosting this plain text blog on github as I don't feel like
using web tech anymore.

Here are the links if you wanna take a look at the mentioned software:
